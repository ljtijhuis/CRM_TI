# CRM TI

This is an old (~2009) hobby project that I built for a family member. It is a (Dutch) Customer Relationship Management system built with PHP + Propel (ORM) + Smarty (template engine).

## Functionalities

The main functionalities are:
  * Registration of companies and contacts at those companies
  * Registration of interactions (phone, email, appointments, etc)
  * Registration of (sale) opportunities
  * Registration of follow-ups (and keeping track of when to do them + marking them as "done")
  * Export of contact information (including some filtering options etc)

## Disclaimer

* It was built as one of my "hobby projects" back in 2009 and in no way perfect. It was used by a small company (~20 employees) and later by a small team (~5 people) for sponsorship acquisition.
* There might be some hosting specific code here and there, I've stripped most of it from the codebase.
* That said, you would probably have to figure out how to set up Smarty and Propel. In retrospective I lacked documentation skills back then ;-)
* Oh yeah, the language used is Dutch and no i18n was implemented.
